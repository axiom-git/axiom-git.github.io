                    <p>
                        Over the past few days, we have been rolling out a new
                        logo and name attached to it, which could eventually
                        replace our current branding for Lumin. Upon launch, we
                        got mostly negative feedback from our users. They
                        expressed dislike towards the logo, and for some the
                        name as well. We have published this article as a way to
                        possibly get even more feedback on our upcoming brand
                        changes, and end with a product that our users and staff
                        can agree on. For now, this change will be temporary and
                        may not last if we don't get enough support from the
                        community or staff to push the changes.

                            >Motivation Behind the Change</span
                        >
                        Initially, our team thought that 'Lumin Labs' was a
                        great fit for a name. 'Lumin' is the greek root for
                        light, which represents our innovations; 'Labs' is an
                        expression of how we experiment with new technologies
                        with our innovations. Meanwhile, 'Axiom' represents
                        trustworthiness, precision, and clarity. We believe that
                        this aligns much more with our beliefs going forward.
                        Instead of abandoning projects, for example, we want to
                        become more trustworthy instead and offer support and
                        help where it is needed.

                            >Logo Design Concepts</span
                        >
                        We currently have developed <b>three</b> logo design
                        concepts that are able to be used publicly:
                    </p>
                    <div
                        class="flex gap-6 mt-8 mb-8 overflow-x-auto select-none"
                    >
                        <div>
                            <img
                                class="rounded-[18px] size-50 border-2 border-info"
                                src="../public/articles/branding-changes/pilot0.png"
                            />
                            <p class="text-info mt-2">Concept 1 (original)</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <img
                                class="rounded-[18px] size-50 border-2 border-info"
                                src="../public/articles/branding-changes/pilot1.png"
                            />
                            <p class="text-info mt-2">Concept 2 (rollout)</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <img
                                class="rounded-[18px] size-50 border-2 border-info"
                                src="../public/articles/branding-changes/pilot2.png"
                            />
                            <p class="text-info mt-2">Concept 3 (current)</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The original concept was the one displayed before the
                        rollout, which most users may not have seen. Concept 2
                        was displayed on the rollout, which is the one that did
                        not get very good feedback. After some recommended
                        changes, we now have ended up with Concept 3.

                            >Why Our Previous Branding Didn't Stick</span
                        >
                        Our previous branding, being 'Lumin Labs' didn't stick
                        because it no longer matches our goals and what we want
                        to represent anymore. Instead of being actively
                        competitive in the development space (being the light),
                        we instead want to focus on our community and growing
                        it. Along with this, many organizations with similar
                        goals as us already exist under the same name, which was
                        another motivation for us to change the branding.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        And as for our logo, we obviously didn't keep it due to
                        the name change pilot. It looked good for a while,
                        however, some people started to catch on to its
                        similarity with the Linux Mint logo, which it was
                        inspired from. Our community liked it, so we took
                        aspects from it in order to design our new concept logos
                        for the pilot.

                            >What We Need From You</span
                        >
                        In order for this rebrand to go successful, we
                        <i>need</i> to gather feedback on our logos and name to
                        appease the masses. If you are reading this article,
                        make sure to vote in the polls in our Discord when you
                        finish. We understand that these changes might be
                        frustrating, but it's simply a part of any community's
                        lifetime. We are still relatively small, so there is
                        plenty of room for major improvements like this.

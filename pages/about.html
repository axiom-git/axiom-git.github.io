		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>A short summary of our goals and why we are here today.</p>
		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Create an inclusive environment open to anyone with any skillset</li>
			<li>Work on projects that benefit the people in the open source software community</li>
			<li>Create high quality games that are enjoyed and cherrished by their players</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>What are we?</h2>
		<p>We are a non-profit organization that creates open source software for our community. We value feedback first
			and foremost and have been reiterating on everything we make since we were established as Canary Softworks
			in <i>2021.</i></p>
		<h2>Brief history</h2>
		<p>Our team has been interested in creating open source software since 2021 when we were founded by James under
			the name Canary Softworks. At this point (and at the time or writing) we still focus on Roblox-centric
			projects. Since then, we have made many contributions for our partners and commmunity.</p>
		<h2>How we got here today</h2>
		<p>Through hard work and discipline. Some things may not sound like they are possible, but they can be if you
			put in the effort. That is what we have applied here!</p>
